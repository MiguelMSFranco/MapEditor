Yo! 

This was a "paint" style program made around my 5th week of my CodeForAll_ Bootcamp. 

It uses a library called "SimpleGFX" made by CodeForAll_

COMMANDS: 
WASD or Arrow Keys to move the cursor

Space bar to paint (you can hold it down to keep painting) 

T to write to a local file. 

Y to read from the local file. 

R to reverse the colors. 

C to clear the canvas.

Press H for a secret feature!
